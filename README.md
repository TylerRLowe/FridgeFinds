# Fridge Finds

Fridge Finds is an android app that recommends recipes to users based on the ingredients they already have. Features include finding recipes, saving recipes and adding them to a meal planner. Users can plan meals for days of the week or organize them into meal categories. Users should add ingredients they own to their fridge, so the app is able to properly recommend recipes. Users are able to add items to a shopping list, check them off, and delete them. On the explore recipes page, the user can filter and search for recipes relevant to them and tailored to their wants and needs.
