**Tasks:**

Log in/sign up (almost done)
* When opening the app, the user is prompted to sign up or log in using an email address, phone number, and password, or through their Facebook or Apple account. Users create accounts so data can be saved, and users can access their Fridge, Shopping List, Saved Recipes, and Meal Planner.
* Currently, account data is only saved during the current session. If the user closes the app and reopens it, they need to create a new account. They cannot log in with the information previously used in their last session.

  * There are icons at the bottom for signup/login, including Facebook and other social media accounts. (incomplete)

Explore Recipes (almost done)
* This is where users go to find new recipes. Users are able to search for recipes using keywords or can choose different options from the filter menu if they want a broader selection. Searching using keywords and selecting filters can be used at the same time to search for recipes. Some examples of keywords: cuisine type (Italian, Mexican), type of food (cake, chicken, potatoes), exclude items (no tomatoes, no cheese). Some examples of filter options: gluten free, vegan, kosher, sugar free, meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

Fridge (completed)
* Users can add ingredients they own to their Fridge. When adding an ingredient, the user will enter the name, amount, and expiration date of the ingredient.
